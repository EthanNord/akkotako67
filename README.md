A 65% keyboard with WS2812B rgb LED strips for underglow and two rotary encoders.

This keyboard uses an Elite-C microcontroller for the keyboard with LED lights and rotary encoders.

The layout was designed using keyboard-layout-editor.com, with the KiCad project file produced by keyboard-tools.xyz. All modifications to the PCB were made in KiCad 7.0. Please see git history for the keyboard's progress.

This keyboard was designed and manufactured by Sofia McNary, Colton Yates, Sam Warr, Kevin James, and Brandon Flexman.

This model does not have traces. This PCB model has nets and components, and is meant for tutorials in how to design PCBs using KiCad for the 2024-2025 BYU IEEE student branch project.
